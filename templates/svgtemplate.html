    <!-- These templates are weird, and there is a reason for that.
     In safari, to update the SVG, I need to basically recreate the entire element from scratch.
     To do that, I grab these templates, get the HTML as a string, and replace the [[[]]] tags.
     See Shape.fillTemplate in gameboard.js for more info.
     Side note: Because of the [[[]]] template tags, the following few elements show
     errors in IDEs, and also in the developer console when the webpage loads. This is fine,
     because anything surrounded by [[[]]] gets replaced with (hopefully) good values
     when the element is actually added to the SVG. -->
